# Cross-Chain NFT Lending for GHO with Chainlink CCIP Integration

## Overview

Welcome to our GitHub repository for the hackathon project aiming to become a GHO facilitator. In this project, we focus on enabling cross-chain lending of whitelisted NFTs to mint GHO, a stablecoin created by the Aave protocol and collateralized by various assets. To achieve this, we leverage Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol for seamless communication between different blockchain networks.
